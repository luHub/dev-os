# Side Quest "Linux Kernel"

After 10+ years working in software there is some hope that the disciple aquired over time is there to write or at least understand the Linux Kernel. So, citing again the Dunningâ€“Kruger lets
face reality "I know nothing" which is relaxing because that means that I need to learn everything and expectations are low but not zero.

I will start this side quest here "https://kernelnewbies.org/" with 0 XP. First step would be to read, no rush, just read.
