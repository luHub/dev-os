Adventures in Linux, be aware that is the verbose long-long log. I promise there will be a short-short log later with condensed information. 

## Resurfacing old tablet

As a complete noob in this realm but with some insights about hardware, software and the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect this starts with reverese enginnering at hardware level.
 
### Hardware

After checking [Cracking Open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAaB-jC85dg). An eye hardware inspection might damage some parts, 
due to the assembly of the tablet, and me. 

#### Attempt 1:
- ```adb``` as primary source of information. See: [tools-android](https://github.com/luHub/dev-os/tree/main/tools-android)

#### Attempt 2:
- Hardware eye inspection as a fallback on another tablet (to avoid breaking this one)

### Side Quest "Linux Kernel"
- Grasp basics about the Linux Kernel, the only way to learn here is by doing. See "QUEST_1" 

### Code:
Need to Root the device to get more insights of the code.
