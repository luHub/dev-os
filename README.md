Adventures in Linux, be aware that is the verbose long-long log. I promise there will be a short-short log later with condensed information. 

## Resurfacing old tablet

As a complete noob in this realm but with some insights about hardware, software and the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect this starts with reverese enginnering at hardaware level.
 
### Hardware

After checking some sources https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAaB-jC85dg. Going directly to a hardware eye inspection might damage some parts, 
due to the assembly of the tablet, and me. 

#### Attempt 1:
- ```adb``` and internet information as primary source of information.

#### Attempt 2:
- Hardware eye inspection as a fallback on another tablet (to avoid breaking this one)

### Specs:

```
Model: GT-N8010
SoC:
